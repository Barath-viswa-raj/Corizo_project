# Corizo_project
During my internship at Corizo, in collaboration with Wipro, I was thrilled to dive deep into the fascinating world of data science. This experience was not only challenging but also incredibly rewarding. I worked on two major projects that really pushed my boundaries and helped me grow.

The first was a major project focused on Wine Prediction. Here, I explored various machine learning algorithms to analyze different characteristics of wine and predict their quality ratings. This project was a rich learning experience, teaching me the ins and outs of data preprocessing, feature selection, and the importance of thorough model evaluation.

The second was a minor project centered around Stock Prediction. This involved building predictive models to forecast stock pricesâ€”a task that sharpened my understanding of time-series analysis and data visualization. Through this project, I learned to implement predictive algorithms effectively, striving for accuracy in every prediction.
